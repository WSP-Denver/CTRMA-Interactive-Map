    <h2>MoPac South Environmental Study</h2>
    <p>The MoPac Expressway south of Cesar Chavez Street is a vital artery in Austin for commuters, neighbors, and visitors.
      The Mobility Authority is proposing to add one-to-two variably-priced express lanes in each direction along approximately
      eight miles of MoPac south of downtown. The project was also the recipient of State of Texas RIDER 42 funds for project
      development. The Environmental Assessment is being prepared by the Mobility Authority with support from TxDOT. </p>

        <li>If we do nothing to address congestion on MoPac South, drivers could spend an additional 35 minutes traveling the
          corridor by 2035.</li>
        <li>The project will provide over 3 million hours of annual travel time savings for all users compared to doing nothing.</li>

  <h2>MoPac Express Lane</h2>
  <p>
    The MoPac Express Lane gives drivers the option to bypass congestion on the 11-mile stretch of MoPac from Cesar Chavez Street to Parmer Lane by adding an Express Lane in each direction. The project was created as an effort to address the corridor&rsquor;s mobility problem and takes into account the needs of drivers, transit riders, pedestrians, bicyclists, and preserves quality of life for
    surrounding neighbors.

  <h2>MoPac Express Lane</h2>
  <p>The MoPac Express Lane gives drivers the option to bypass congestion on the 11-mile stretch of MoPac from Cesar Chavez
    Street to Parmer Lane by adding an Express Lane in each direction. The project was created as an effort
    to address the corridor&rsquor;s mobility problem and takes into account the needs of drivers, transit riders, pedestrians,
    bicyclists, and preserves quality of life for surrounding neighbors. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>By 2035, MoPac is projected to serve more than 222,000 cars a day.</li>
        <li>During the first six months of operations, 56% of drivers used the northbound MoPac Express Lane only once, and 94% used
          it less than 10 times. This demonstrates that most drivers use the lane only when they need it most, as projected.</li>
        <li>Toyotas, Chevrolets, and Fords accounted for nearly 40% of vehicles in the Express Lane between November 2017 and
          April 2018.</li>
        <li>With average speeds above 50 miles per hour, the Express Lane allows drivers up to a 50 percent faster commute. </li>

  <h2>71 Toll Lane</h2>
  <p>SH 71 serves as a major corridor connecting drivers to the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (ABIA), the city of Bastrop,
    and points beyond. The 71 Toll Lane project added a toll lane in each direction along SH 71 from near Presidential Boulevard
    at ABIA and extending east near SH 130. These new lanes offer a free-flowing and reliable bypass route for through-traffic,
    especially during peak hour congestion.</p>

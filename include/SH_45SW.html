  <h2>45SW Project</h2>
  <p>
    45SW is an innovative four-lane toll road built on state property between MoPac and FM 1626 that is bringing relief to the rapidly growing area of northern Hays and southern Travis counties. This project balances environmental sensitivity with new infrastructure to manage congestion in the region. 45SW includes a 4.5-mile, ten-foot-wide shared use path (SUP), the 45SW Trail, that is an
    important link for the Violet Crown Trail, a future 30-mile urban trail system. 45SW Trail also fosters environmental stewardship through educational signage and an augmented reality mobile app that teaches the community about the importance of the Texas Hill Country and Edwards Aquifer.

      <li>45SW opened to traffic on June 1, 2019 and now more than 13,000 cars use the road each weekday.</li>

        45SW features a beautiful shared use path with informational signage that informs pedestrians and bikers about the history and wildlife of the region. A corresponding mobile app, Trail Explorer by CTRMA, combines audio narration in English and Spanish, as well as innovative augmented reality features to further the benefits of the trail signage. The app engages users on the historical and
        environmental treasure that is the Edwards Aquifer to cultivate conservation.

    <h2>183 South Project</h2>
    <p>The Mobility Authority is upgrading US 183 to a new tolled expressway built for tolled and non-tolled travel, as well
      as bicycle and pedestrian use. The project includes six new tolled lanes and up to six improved, non-tolled lanes between
      US 290 and SH 71, as well as $25 million worth of pedestrian and bicyclist accommodations.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>183 South is not just the largest roadway project our region has seen since SH 130, it&rsquor;s also the largest
          project implemented by a local entity since the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.</li>
        <li>The project will include enough new pavement to construct a single 96-mile lane that could cover the distance between
          Austin and San Antonio.</li>
        <li>When open to traffic, a trip on the entire eight-mile 183 South Toll will cost less than $3 for electronic toll tag
          customers, and even less for shorter trips.</li>

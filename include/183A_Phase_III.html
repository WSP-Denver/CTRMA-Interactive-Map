	<h2>183A Toll Phase III</h2>
	<p>The proposed 183A Phase III tollway project will have two tolled lanes in each direction to start, and will ultimately be widened to three lanes, to help relieve congestion and enhance mobility for residents of Cedar Park, Leander, and Liberty Hill. The 6.6-mile stretch will be an extension of the existing 183A Toll north from Hero Way to north of SH 29.</p>

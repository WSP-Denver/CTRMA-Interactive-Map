  <h2>183 North Mobility Project</h2>
  <p>The 183 North Project will add two variably-priced express lanes in each direction in the existing median along US 183
    between MoPac and SH 45, and widen the highway where required to bring the total number of general-purpose lanes to four
    in each direction. Other improvements include two new shared-use path segments near Pond Springs Drive, new sidewalks
    and cross-street connections for bicycles/pedestrians. Construction is anticipated to begin in early 2020.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Average southbound speed on US 183 between SH 45N &amp; MoPac is 43 mph. That&rsquor;s expected to be 10 mph by 2035
          if we don&rsquor;t build 183 North.</li>
        <li>By building 183 North, we expect to provide a reliable nine-minute commute for express lane users during AM and PM peak hours, and reduce non-tolled travel times by 24 and 16 minutes for morning and evening commutes, respectively (as compared to doing nothing). </li>
        <li>We&rsquor;re investing more than $5 million for safe connectivity for bicyclists and pedestrians throughout the 183
          North corridor.

	<h2>183 North Mobility Project</h2>
	<p>
		The 183 North Mobility Project includes construction of two express lanes in each direction along a 9-mile stretch of US 183 between SH 45/RM 620 and MoPac (Loop 1); and a general purpose lane where needed to bring the total number of non-tolled lanes to four in each direction. Express lane direct connectors will be constructed with MoPac to the south so users traveling to and from downtown do not have to enter the general purpose lanes. The project also includes operational improvements to MoPac, new shared use path connections, new sidewalks, and cross-street connections for
		bicycles/pedestrians.

		<ul>
      <li>Average southbound speed on US 183 between SH 45N & MoPac is 43 mph. That's expected to be 10 mph by 2035 if we don't build 183 North.</li>
      <li>By building 183 North, we expect travel time reductions in the Express Lanes of 41 minutes for morning commutes and 34 minutes for evening commutes. </li>
      <li>Non-tolled lanes along 183 North will see benefits as well with a travel time reduction of 24 minutes for the morning peak period and 16 minutes for the evening peak period.</li>
      <li>We're investing more than $5 million for safe connectivity for bicyclists and pedestrians throughout the 183 North corridor.</li>

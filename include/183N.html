  <h2>183 North Mobility Project</h2>
  <p>The 183 North Mobility Project includes construction of two express lanes in each direction along a 9-mile stretch of US 183 between SH 45/RM 620 to Loop 1, express lane direct connectors to and from southbound Loop 1, and the addition of a fourth general purpose lane, where required, to bring the total number to four in each direction. The project also includes operational improvements to Loop 1, new shared use path connections, new sidewalks, and cross-street connections for bicycles/pedestrians. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Average southbound speed on US 183 between SH 45N &amp; MoPac is 43 mph. That&rsquor;s expected to be 10 mph by 2035
          if we don&rsquor;t build 183 North.</li>
        <li>By building 183 North, we expect to provide a reliable nine-minute commute for express lane users during AM and PM peak hours, and reduce non-tolled travel times by 24 and 16 minutes for morning and evening commutes, respectively (as compared to doing nothing). </li>
        <li>We&rsquor;re investing more than $5 million for safe connectivity for bicyclists and pedestrians throughout the 183
          North corridor.

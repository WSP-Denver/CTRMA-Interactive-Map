    <h2>290/130 Flyovers project</h2>
    <p>The Mobility Authority will construct three flyovers between the SH 130 and 290 Toll facilities. These flyovers
      will give drivers a free-flowing direct connection and free up capacity on the frontage road intersection
      underneath the toll facilities for drivers who prefer the non-tolled option.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The project will attract up to 5,000 vehicles per day from parallel facilities providing ancillary congestion relief to other non-toll corridors.</li>
        <li>The project will shift approximately 67 percent of vehicles off the southbound SH 130 frontage road and onto the new flyover ramp to westbound 290 Toll.</li>
        <li>Former Mobility Authority board member James H. Mills was an advocate for the 290/130 Flyovers; the north-to-west and south-to-west flyover bridges will be named in his honor.</li>
